# NLP Roadmap
I am developing a comprehensive NLP roadmap to help students get a grasp of the natural language processing (NLP) landscape. The objective of the NLP Roadmap is to provide comprehensive paper reading lists/recipes, historical overviews, categorization of tools, video/audio educational resources, book recommendations, and other recommendations and prerequisites necessary to become more familiar with the field and how its techniques are being used in the real world. 

Overall, the NLP Roadmap will become a complimentary tool to study and keep updated with NLP concepts. It will also be used as a companion for the upcoming online NLP course I am building. 

Coming Soon!
